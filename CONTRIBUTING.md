# Contributing

This repo uses a lightweight workflow. Keep changes small, reviewable, and consistent.

## Project intent

Contributions should respect the portfolio's **evidence-first** bar (see **Goals and intent** in [README.md](README.md)):

- **Featured projects** are expected to stay aligned with a real case study: constraints, outcomes, honest limits, and proof links where the site makes verifiable claims.
- **Copy and marketing-style changes** that affect what the site claims in public should be checked against [docs/proof-audit.md](docs/proof-audit.md); prefer tightening or softening language over unfounded claims.
- **Optional features** should remain safely gated by environment configuration so default and CI paths stay predictable.

## Commit Message Convention

Use this format:

`type(scope): summary`

Examples:

- `feat(contact): add reply status badges`
- `fix(ci): decouple build from migrate deploy`
- `docs(readme): clarify prisma env placeholders`

Rules:

- Use lowercase `type`.
- Keep `summary` concise and imperative.
- Add `scope` when a specific area is clear (`ci`, `admin`, `projects`, `docs`, etc.).
- Recommended types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`.
- Avoid generic subjects like `update` or `misc` for local WIP commits.
- GitHub merge commits titled `Merge pull request #...` are normal on `main` and do not need to follow the `type(scope):` pattern.

## Merge policy

- Land work on **`main`** through **pull requests** with **CI green** before merge.
- **Default for this repo:** use GitHub's **merge commit** option (not squash-only) so PR boundaries stay visible in history. Write a clear **PR title** (and edit the merge commit subject when GitHub allows) so `git log` stays readable - conventional `type(scope):` titles are welcome when they fit.
- **Squash merge** is fine for small, single-concern PRs when you want one commit on `main`.
- Keep each PR focused on one concern; avoid unrelated drive-by changes in the same PR.

## Author Identity Checklist

Before opening a PR or committing:

1. Verify identity:
    - `git config user.name`
    - `git config user.email`
2. Confirm it matches your chosen project identity (pick one and keep it stable).
3. If signing in via another machine/account, re-check before first commit.
4. After commit, confirm author on latest commit:
    - `git log -1 --format='%h %an <%ae> %s'`

## Text and Encoding Guardrails

- Use ASCII punctuation in first-party docs/UI copy when possible.
- Avoid smart quotes/em dashes/bullets that can render as mojibake in some terminals.
- If copying text from external sources, quickly scan for encoding artifacts before commit.
