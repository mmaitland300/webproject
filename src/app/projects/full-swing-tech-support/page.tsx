            I work this role at Auxillium, which provides technical support for
            Full Swing simulator customers. The examples here center on that
            stack; many of the same environments also include Laser Shot or E6
            Golf from TruGolf, supported in the same workflow. The case study is
            about how multi-layer issues get diagnosed under real constraints,
            where hardware, software, networking, and operating-system behavior
            frequently overlap.

            Incidents were rarely single-point failures. Most escalations
            involved multiple plausible causes and partial signals, creating a
            high risk of quick but unstable fixes. The key challenge was
            identifying root cause with enough confidence to prevent recurrence.

            The consistent tradeoff was speed versus reliability. Fast,
            one-off fixes could close tickets quickly but often increased
            repeat incidents. A structured, reproducible triage path required
            more discipline up front, but produced better long-term resolution
            quality and lower ambiguity on future cases.
